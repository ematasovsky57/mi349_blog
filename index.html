                My freshman year was an interesting time for me. It was the first time I was away from home for a long time, 
                as my previous longest stay away from my family was 2 weeks, as part of my high school sponsored study abroad
                 which had taken place earlier than summer. Obviously, I was not used to having roommates, as I never had to even 
                 share a room with my sister when I was younger. On top of that, there was the number of people up at Michigan
                  State. As a kid who had never had a class larger than 25 people, ever, I was overwhelmed at first. Additionally,
                   the largest school I had been a part of was my 200-person total high school. At points, I felt like just a 
                   number and found it harder than I had imagined making friends. I remember telling my friend one time 
                   “the only part of college that I am appreciating so far is the amount of free time and the focus of the
                    classes.” Without my roommate, Carter, I would have felt a lot more lost up at MSU, as he was a great friend 
                    of mine and still is today. It was always a tradition for us to find the dining hall with the best food and
                     head on over to it at least two or three times a week. While not a wild or crazy tradition, it made me feel 
                     a lot more accepted at MSU and helped me through all the challenges that a new school and community brought.

              <h3>The Reckless, yet Lovable, Kittens</h3>

            <p>When my cat, Bella, died in January, I was devastated. Bella had been with our family since I was three months old and
                 was always a source of love and amusement in our house. Whether it was chasing our dog around the house (yes, our 12 pound
                  cat chased the 75 pound labradoodle), or crawling into our lap to cuddle, she always brought joy. In February, after nearly
                   a month of mourning and missing Bella, we came to the decision to adopt a new pair of kittens. The first place we went 
                   ended up having a pair of kittens who were 7 and 8 months old. Within 10 minutes of meeting them, our family was sold on the
                    cats. Jelly and Bean will never fully replace Bella, but they have instead made a whole new set of memories with our family. 
                    These memories aren’t always cuddles, however. I just went home last weekend, and, as I was headed to bed after a late night 
                    of working on homework, I heard a massive crash. Knowing the cats, I instantly put on shoes and thick gloves before going to
                     assess the damage. When I came downstairs, I found a large, deep vase shattered on the ground. This was not a typical flower 
                     vase, but instead at least three feet tall with a filled base. Neither cat had stuck around at the scene of the crime, 
                     so I had to find the kittens to lock them with my mom. Knowing the cats, they would have thought it to be an excellent idea 
                     to play floor hockey with the glass shards. After an hour of clean up, two unhappy cats trekked out of the room. 
                While they might want to test the laws of gravity daily, I would not trade them for the world.</p>
