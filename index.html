                My freshman year was an interesting time for me. It was the first time I was away from home for a long time, 
                as my previous longest stay away from my family was 2 weeks, as part of my high school sponsored study abroad
                 which had taken place earlier than summer. Obviously, I was not used to having roommates, as I never had to even 
                 share a room with my sister when I was younger. On top of that, there was the number of people up at Michigan
                  State. As a kid who had never had a class larger than 25 people, ever, I was overwhelmed at first. Additionally,
                   the largest school I had been a part of was my 200-person total high school. At points, I felt like just a 
                   number and found it harder than I had imagined making friends. I remember telling my friend one time 
                   “the only part of college that I am appreciating so far is the amount of free time and the focus of the
                    classes.” Without my roommate, Carter, I would have felt a lot more lost up at MSU, as he was a great friend 
                    of mine and still is today. It was always a tradition for us to find the dining hall with the best food and
                     head on over to it at least two or three times a week. While not a wild or crazy tradition, it made me feel 
                     a lot more accepted at MSU and helped me through all the challenges that a new school and community brought.
