            <p>I am Emmett Matasovsky, a senior at Michigan State pursuing a degree in Media and Information Management. I am 21 years 
                old, having just turned 21 in August. I graduated from Lutheran High School Westland in the Spring of 2018 and 
                continued my schooling at MSU all four years. I own two pets, both kittens, Jelly and Bean, who have a post 
                dedicated to them over on my blog. I have one sibling, my sister Jillian, who graduated from Michigan State as well. 
                My hobbies are listed below :)

            <p>Since I have been old enough to play sports, I have always been participating in one. As my hobbies show, 
                now that I am in college I still actively go to and watch them. When I actively played sports, my favorites were 
                football, track, and soccer. I played 6 years for football, 4 years for soccer, and track for 7 years. I also did 
                basketball for 2 years, softball for 1 year, and cross country for 2 years. Gaming and music are also self explanatory, 
                as I love to play around on my Xbox or computer when I have free time, and I always love having tickets to a concert 
                to look forward to. I have been to concerts for Post Malone, Pentatonix, and OneRepublic, to name a few.
