            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Emmett Matasovsky, a senior at Michigan State pursuing a degree in Media and Information Management. I am 21 years 
                old, having just turned 21 in August. I graduated from Lutheran High School Westland in the Spring of 2018 and 
                continued my schooling at MSU all four years. I own two pets, both kittens, Jelly and Bean, who have a post 
                dedicated to them over on my blog. I have one sibling, my sister Jillian, who graduated from Michigan State as well. 
                My hobbies are listed below :)
